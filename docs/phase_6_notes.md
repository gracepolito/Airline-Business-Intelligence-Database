# Phase 6 – Final Deliverables & Presentation

## Overview

Phase 6 packages the Airline Business Intelligence Database into a complete, submission-ready capstone.  
This phase focuses on:

- Producing polished presentation materials  
- Exporting all SQL, ETL, and notebook artifacts  
- Recording and editing a professional walkthrough video  
- Ensuring the repository is clean, consistent, and reproducible  

All work was implemented in:

- `docs/Airline BI Database - Presentation Slide.pdf` – final slide deck  
- `docs/Airline BI Database - Presentation Script.pdf` – complete narrated script  
- `docs/Airline BI Database - Presentation.mp4` – recorded presentation video  
- Supporting SQL, ETL, and Python files stored throughout the repo

## 1. Documentation & Presentation Packaging

Phase 6 required assembling a complete documentation set that presents the project clearly and professionally.

### A. Final Slide Deck
1. 21-slide presentation summarizing all project phases  
2. Includes ERD, ETL flow, SQL analytics, and Python visualizations  
3. Exported as `docs/Airline BI Database - Presentation Slides.pdf`  

### B. Presentation Script
1. Full narrative aligned to each slide  
2. Ensures consistent pacing and clarity in delivery  
3. Exported as `Airline BI Database - Presentation Script.pdf`  

### C. Supporting Documentation
4. Key PNG visuals exported to `docs/`  
5. Phase notes (`phase_1_notes.md` through `phase_6_notes.md`)  
6. ERD and query references for documentation completeness

## 2. Exporting SQL, ETL, and Notebook Artifacts

Static, reviewable versions of all code assets were exported for grading and long-term reference.

### A. SQL & ETL Exports
- `sql/01_schema.sql`  
- `sql/03_dml_cleanup.sql`  
- `sql/04_constraints_indexes.sql`  
- `sql/analytics/*.sql`  

### B. Notebook PDF Exports
- `02_data_quality_checks` → `docs/nb_02_data_quality_checks.pdf`  
- `03_analytics_queries` → `docs/nb_03_analytics_queries.pdf`  
- `04_python_analytics` → `docs/nb_04_python_analytics.pdf`  

### C. Repo Structure
- Verified clean folder layout for `sql/`, `etl/`, `notebooks/`, and `docs/`  
- Checked all file references and links for correctness

## 3. Presentation Video Recording

The final capstone presentation was recorded on camera and edited using **DaVinci Resolve**.

Steps included:

1. Recording a full walkthrough of the 21-slide deck  
2. Editing to sync narration with slides, SQL, and visuals  
3. Ensuring clear audio, smooth pacing, and clean transitions  
4. Exporting a polished 20 minute MP4 video  

**Deliverable:** `docs/Airline BI Database - Presentation.mp4`  

This video provides the complete narrative explanation of all technical and analytical work.

## 4. Final QA & Repository Consistency Check

A final quality review ensured the capstone was complete and reproducible.

Key steps:

- Re-ran all analytics notebooks  
- Validated schema, ERD, and documentation alignment  
- Ensured SQL scripts compile without error  
- Confirmed visuals, PDFs, and notes render correctly in GitHub  
- Final `git status` and commit to ensure no missing files

## 5. Final Deliverables Summary

### Primary Deliverables
- **Airline BI Database - Presentation Slides.pdf**  
- **Airline BI Database - Presentation Script.pdf**  
- **Airline BI Database - Presentation.mp4**

### Supporting Deliverables
- SQL and ETL scripts  
- Notebook PDF exports  
- BI visualizations (PNG)  
- Phase documentation (`phase_1_notes.md` → `phase_6_notes.md`)  

Together, these artifacts form the complete, portfolio-ready Airline Business Intelligence Database capstone project.
